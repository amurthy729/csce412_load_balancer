# Load Balancer

This was made for a cloud computing course at Texas A&M University

To Run the program use `make` in a linux terminal and then `./lb`

The program simulates a load balancer, with the default configuration being that any webserver can handle up to 10 connections.
Requests can be a random amount of time, and requests randomly can come in during execution time.
